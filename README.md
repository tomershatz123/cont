# Cont2

This project was written as a home assignment for a company I was interviewed in.
The user should upload 2 xlsx files. One of vessels and the other of telemetries.
The application should read the files and find matching between event and vessel.
A match is when an event row and vessel row both have the same longitude and latitude values, and Time and Received values should be up to 15 minutes deifference.
Upload the files from ./src/data directory.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.
